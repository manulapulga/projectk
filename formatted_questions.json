There is no application of chemical/inorganic fertilizers at all in this. \n4. The scope for intercropping is more in this compared to the conventional method of cultivation. Select the correct answer using the code given below.",

  "Question_Data_Folder\\KPSC\\Mock Test\\Degree Level\\Degree Prelims\\2026 - Company Board, University Assistant, Sl, Excise Inspector, SBCID\\QB.xlsx::UPSC::0::explanation": "\n(B) is correct.The Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative (SSI) promotes resource-efficient practices like using less seed material, wider spacing, and drip irrigation. These reduce input costs (1) and improve water use efficiency (2). Wider spacing also enables intercropping (4). However, it does not completely eliminate chemical fertilizers.Hence statement 3 is incorrect."
